Hey, you've reached my webpage! You can find some things I've worked on by clicking on the sidebar.
</p>
<p>
Most of the content on my website is in the <a href="notes">notes</a> section.<br>
A list of my publications is available in the <a href="publications">publications</a> section.
</p>
<p>
In some of the extra time I had over COVID, I made a short series of puzzles which can be found <a href="./secret">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can also anonymously contact me <a href="https://forms.gle/FqPA4gfSRpakahbTA">here</a>.<br>
If you want a response back, you should just email me (you can find my contact information in the <a href="./about">About</a> section).
