	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/"><i>Disco Elysium</i></a>: This is in my opinion the pinnacle of gaming. It represents everything about the medium that allows it to be so much more expressive than any other -- you will find yourself rolling on the floor in laughter one moment and sobbing your heart out the next. Play it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste/"><i>Celeste</i></a>: Celeste tells the simple, yet beautiful, story of Madeline, a girl who climbs a mountain. Its difficulty is sure to crush you at first, but like Madeline, you learn to conquer seemingly insurmountable odds and emerge victorious. It has perhaps the most perfect movement system of any game I have played, and mastering it and discovering its intricacies will reward you tenfold.</li>
	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814380/Sekiro_Shadows_Die_Twice__GOTY_Edition/"><i>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</i></a>: Sekiro is to combat what Celeste is to movement. In the game, FromSoftware has crafted an immaculate combat system which, like Celeste, rewards your mastery tenfold. Do not hesitate in playing this one.
	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/Dishonored/"><i>Dishonored</i></a>: Unlike the earlier games in this list, I don't really have much to say about this one. It's just really fun to mess around in and is infinitely replayable.</li>
	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237970/Titanfall_2/"><i>Titanfall 2</i></a>: For the most part, I dislike shooters. Two exceptions to this are Titanfall 2 and ULTRAKILL. With incredibly tight movement, the game feels incredibly fun when you play it as intended, zipping around the map at 50 miles per hour while taking down hostiles.</li>
	<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/"><i>ULTRAKILL</i></a>: For the most part, I dislike shooters. Two exceptions to this are ULTRAKILL and Titanfall 2. The developer is endlessly creative -- by the end, you will be punching cannonballs and reflecting electric beams off coins to shoot rockets.</li>
