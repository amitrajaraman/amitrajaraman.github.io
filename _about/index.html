Hello! I'm Amit, a first year PhD student in the Theory group at MIT. I am supported by the <a href="https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/">Akamai Presidential Fellowship</a>.<br>

Before this, I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay, where I graduated with a BTech with honors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. <br>
