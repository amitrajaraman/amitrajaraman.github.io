<p>Hello! I'm Amit, a second year PhD student in the <a href="https://toc.csail.mit.edu/">Theory group</a> at MIT, where I am fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.samuelbhopkins.com/">Sam Hopkins</a> and <a href="https://kuikuiliu.github.io/">Kuikui Liu</a>. In my first year, I was supported by an <a href="https://web.mit.edu/provost/presfellow/">Akamai Presidential Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in probability in theoretical computer science.<br>Recently, I have been thinking a lot about Markov chains.

<p>A list of my publications can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can contact me at <code>a[*]_r@[*].edu</code> after replacing <code>[*]</code> with the last three letters of my name.</p>

<p>Before my PhD, I did my undergrad at IIT Bombay, where I graduated with a BTech with honors in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. While at IITB, I had the privilege of working with <a href="https://homepages.iitb.ac.in/~niranj/">Niranjan Balachandran</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/navingo/">Navin Goyal</a>, <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~hariharan.narayanan/">Hariharan Narayanan</a>, and <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~piyush.srivastava/">Piyush Srivastava</a>. </p>
